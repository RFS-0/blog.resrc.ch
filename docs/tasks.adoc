== Tasks

In this chapter all tasks to be done are described.
Each task must describe a clear expected result.
Task with open questions are described in link:#tasks-with-open-questions[tasks with open questions].

All tasks should contain at least the following information:

. Goal - why is this task necessary?
. Requirements - what is the expected result and its constraints?
. Hints - which information we know already can be used to implement this task?
. Result - must be verifiable

Thus, the following can be used as a template for a task:

* Goal
** `<goal and the reason why it makes sense to achieve it>`
* Requirements
** `<list of requirements and their constrains>`
* Hints
** `<hints which can be used to implement the task>`
* Result
** `<description of the expected result>`
