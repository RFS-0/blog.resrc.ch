== Architecture

This chapter describes the architecture of my blog.
The term is used in a very broad sense.
Things that are considered architecture are:

* Information Architecture
* UI/UX Design
* Navigation
* Responsiveness
* Technical Infrastructure
* SEO

The following chapters describe each of these aspects in detail.

=== Navigation

I try to design the navigation as simple and intuitive as possible.
It should eventually be possible to see the content of the blog visualized as a graph.
The graph should be queryable and navigable.
For now it is just a list of links.
A simplified version of the navigation is shown below:

plantuml::./diagrams/sitemap.puml[format=svg]

It is simplified because lower nodes might have links back to higher nodes which are not shown here.
