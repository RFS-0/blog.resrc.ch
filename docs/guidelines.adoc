== Guidelines

To build this blog I decided to use the following guidelines:

* Try to follow best practices for documentation, development and deployment
* Document the reasoning behind decisions
* Document the process of creating the blog
* Focus on the content and the design
* Use state-of-the-art tools and technologies
* Start with the simplest solution and improve it over time

The following chapters describe how I try to follow these guidelines.
